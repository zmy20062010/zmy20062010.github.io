Karl Broman is Professor in the
[Department of Biostatistics &amp; Medical Informatics](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu)
at the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison;
research in statistical genetics; developer of
[R/qtl](http://www.rqtl.org) (for [R](http://www.r-project.org)).

Karl received a BS in [mathematics](http://www4.uwm.edu/letsci/math/)
in 1991, from the 
University of Wisconsin&ndash;Milwaukee, and a
PhD in [Statistics](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu) in 1997, from the
University of California, Berkeley; his PhD advisor was
[Terry Speed](http://www.wehi.edu.au/faculty_members/professor_terry_speed).
He was a postdoctoral fellow with [James Weber](https://www.preventiongenetics.com/about-us/senior-staff/) at the
[Marshfield Clinic Research Foundation](http://research.marshfieldclinic.org),
1997-1999. He
was a faculty member in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns
Hopkins University, 1999-2007. In 2007, he moved to the
University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison,
where he is now Professor.

Karl is an applied statistician focusing on problems in genetics and
genomics, particularly the analysis of meiotic recombination and the
genetic dissection of complex traits in experimental organisms. The
latter is often called &ldquo;QTL mapping.&rdquo; A QTL is a
_quantitative trait locus_ &ndash; a genetic locus that influences a
quantitative trait. Recently he has been focusing on the development
of interactive data visualizations for high-dimensional genetic data;
see his [R/qtlcharts package](http://kbroman.org/qtlcharts) and
his [D3 page](http://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/D3).
